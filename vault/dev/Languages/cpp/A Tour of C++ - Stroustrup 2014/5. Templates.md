A more powerful version of Generics
### Idea

When implementing a generic class we often don't to constrict users of that class to only be able to use that class with one type.

**A template is a class or function that we parameterize with a set of types or values.**

Templates don't exist until we call it! A way for us to get the compiler to write code for us based on our usage.
