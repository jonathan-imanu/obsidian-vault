### Classes

A function / method with the same name as the class is called the constructor.

**A struct is simply a class with members public by default**
### Union 

A struct where all members are allocated at the same address so that the union occupies only as much space as its largest member. A union can only hold a value for one member at a time.

**Advice:** Use a tagged enum with real functionality hidden behind a abstraction since maintaining correspondence with the tag and access will be error prone.
