# `with` statement

Sets up a temporary context and reliably tears it down under the control of a context manager object.
### Context Manager Objects

**Context manager** objects exist to control a with statement, just like iterators exist to control a for statement.

The context manager interface consists of the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. At the top of the with, Python calls the `__enter__` method of the context manager object. When the with block completes or terminates for any reason, Python calls `__exit__` on the context manager object.

Refer to this, if you think we ever need to build our own context manager: https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html
- Having a try/finally (or a with block) around the yield is an unavoidable price of using `@contextmanager`
