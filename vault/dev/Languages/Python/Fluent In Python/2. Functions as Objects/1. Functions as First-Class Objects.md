### First-Class Objects

Programming language researchers define a “first-class object” as a program entity that can be:

- Created at runtime 
- Assigned to a variable or element in a data structure
- Passed as an argument to a function 
- Returned as the result of a function

**Go** also has functions as first-class objects

**Higher-Order Functions** take in other functions as an argument or return a function as their result

#### Usage of the special method `__call__` 

A class implementing `__call__` is an easy way to create function-like objects that have some internal state that must be kept across invocations

### The Difference between kwargs & args

In a function ordering is:

1. positional
2. `*args`
	1. Just values within a tuple under the hood
	2. The name is irrelevant, anything with * would work
3. kw only params
4. `**kwargs`
	1. A dictionary of kw: val 
	2. The name is irrelevant, anything with ** would work


#### / allows for positional-only args in funcs

```python 
def divmod(a, b, /):
	return (a // b, a % b)
	
# can't do divmod(a=10, b=4) only divmod(10, 4)
```

**It's old but map, filter & reduce are talked about on page 235**
