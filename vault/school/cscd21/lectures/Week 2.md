### Decentralized Ledger (over a P2P network)

- All node have a copy of the ledger and ensure local correctness

**Pros:**
- No single point of failure
- Better reliability since network can handle some nodes going down
- Better security since some nodes can be malicious but the rest of the network has legitimate ledger
**Cons:**
- Harder to authenticate users
- Consistency is harder because of P2P
