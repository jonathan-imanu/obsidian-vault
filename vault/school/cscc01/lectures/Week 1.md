### SDLC Phases

1. Planning - requirement gathering and development of the SRS.
2. Design - The architecture is developed during the design phase and the design document is created.
3. Development - Coding takes place
4. Testing - Issues with the code are found and fixed if possible.
5. Deployment - Releasing the code to the production environment.
6. Maintenance - Feedback is collected from stakeholders, other UI issues may be identified, and code enhancements suggested.
