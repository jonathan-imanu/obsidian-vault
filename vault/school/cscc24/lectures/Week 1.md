# Lecture Notes

Language is an arbitrary collection of forms with their meanings.
- Syntax: specification of the forms
- Semantics: specification of the meanings

### High Level Languages

**Translation**: Covering a high-level language into machine language

There are two general methods:
1. Compilation: Whole program is translated before execution
2. Interpretation: Translate and execute one statement at a time
