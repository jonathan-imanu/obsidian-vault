To implement time-sharing effectively, instead of writing the contents of process memory to disk, we opt to leave it inside memory. 

> How do we prevent processes from modifying each others memory?

The abstraction of *address spaces*

**Address Spaces** are an abstraction provided by the OS of physical memory. It contains all of the memory state of the running program. For example, instructions would be in an address space.

![[OSTEP Figure 13.3 An Example Address Space.png]]

The placement of the heap and stack like this is just convention BUT we do it in this manner because both the heap and stack can grow!

Of course, the OS virtualizes the memory provided to the process so the address space doesn't start at the physical location 0KB.

Virtualized memory should be:

- **transparent** as in the process using the abstraction has no idea virtualization is taking place.
- **efficient** in terms of time and space
- **protected** so the processes are safe from one another and the OS should be safe from processes
	- processes should be *isolated* so that one can fail without affecting the other
