**Address Translation:** The hardware transforms each memory access (e.g., an instruction fetch, load, or store), changing the virtual address provided by the instruction to a physical address where the desired information is actually located.
### Dynamic (Hardware-based) Relocation

#### Base & Bounds / Dynamic Relocation

An older way that isn't used by modern systems. 

There are two hardware registers within each CPU that correspond to the currently running process:
1. Base
2. Bounds

These two registers work together to help translate virtual memory addresses into physical memory addresses:

`physical address = virtual address + base`

The bounds register ensures these addresses are within the confines of address space.

*These are hardware structures that exist on the chip.* May be called the **Memory Management Unit (MMU).**

Of course, the OS is responsible for updating these registers when switching between processes. 

Has the following limitations:

- Stack, heap & instructions are all treated the same
	- Memory can be wasted due to **internal fragmentation** which is when within an address space, memory intended to be free space for the stack and heap to grow is unused.
- Process's address space must correspond to a contiguous block in physical memory
	- So it must fit within memory as well
