**A thread is an abstraction of a single execution context within a process.** Each thread is a lot like a separate process but:
1. They are share the same address space and memory. Within this address space, each thread will have it's own stack.
2. Instead of Process Control Blocks, we save state to *Thread Control Blocks* when doing context switching

## Definitions

A *critical section* is a piece of code that accesses a shared variable / resource.

A *race condition* arises if multiple threads of execution enter the critical section at roughly the same time; both attempt to update the shared data structure, leading to a surprising (and perhaps undesirable) outcome

An *indeterminate program* consists of one or more race conditions
