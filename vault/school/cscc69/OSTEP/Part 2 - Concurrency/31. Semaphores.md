*Objects with an integer value that can be manipulated with two routines.* We be used to synchronize between threads within the same process (and even synchronize access across different processes)

Once initialized we can interact with it in two ways:

```
int sem_wait(sem_t *s) { 
	decrement the value of semaphore s by one 
	wait if value of semaphore s is negative 
} 

int sem_post(sem_t *s) { 
	increment the value of semaphore s by one
	if there are one or more threads waiting, wake one
}
```

### Binary Semaphores

> Behave just like locks

If a Semaphore has an initial value of 1, and when a thread "acquires" the semaphore it calls `sem_wait` and `sem_post` when it is done. If a thread calls `sem_wait` when the value is 0 (someone else got decremented first), it will wait. 
- The value of the semaphore, when negative, is equal to the number of waiting threads
